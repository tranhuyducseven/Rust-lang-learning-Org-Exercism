### 1.3 Cargo
- We can create a project using cargo new.
- We can build a project using cargo build.
- We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
- We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.

## Chapter 3 Common Programming Concepts
### 3.1 Variables and Mutability
***Shadowing***

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut`, because we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be `immutable` after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between `mut` and `shadowing` is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, and then we want to store that input as a number
